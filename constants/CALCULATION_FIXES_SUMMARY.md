- **Muon Mass (m_μ)** - Fixed: Formula replacement issue
- **Tau Mass (m_τ)** - Fixed: Formula replacement issue
- **Sum of neutrino masses (Σm_ν)** - Fixed: Dependency calculation issue

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Special Case Handlers
Added explicit calculation code for constants that weren't handled by the default formula parser:
- a_p, delta_m_n_p, e_knee, lambda_star, f_b, rho_lambda
- tau_reio, tau_star, delta_nu_t, sigma_m_nu, beta_x

### 2. Fixed Formula Replacement Logic
- Fixed the order of replacements to prevent double-wrapping (e.g., `calculated_values['calculated_values.get(...)']`)
- Added checks to skip replacement if already wrapped in calculated_values.get()
- Handled special constants (v_H, M_Pl, H_0) before dependency replacements

### 3. Fixed Dependency Calculations
- Added proper variable definitions in dependency calculations
- Fixed references to use calculated_values dictionary properly
- Added special handler for m_nu dependency to properly calculate neutrino mass

### 4. Improved Default Formula Parser
- Added detection for complex formulas that need manual implementation
- Fixed mathematical operation replacements (arcsin, sqrt, etc.)
- Added proper handling of constant references in formulas

## Theory Patterns Preserved
All fixes maintained the original theoretical formulas without simplification:
- No adjustments to theoretical patterns
- All cascade formulas preserved exactly as specified
- Correction factors (VEV backreaction, KK geometry, etc.) maintained
- Physical constants and conversion factors unchanged

## Final Result
✅ **All 63 notebooks now execute successfully**
- 0 failures
- All constants calculate according to their theoretical formulas
- Ready for use in the application

## Files Modified
1. `/constants/scripts/generate_notebooks.py` - Main fixes to notebook generation
2. `/constants/scripts/execute_notebooks.py` - Created for testing execution
3. All notebooks in `/constants/notebooks/` - Regenerated with fixes

The constants are now properly calculated while preserving the theoretical patterns from the Topological Fixed Point Theory.
