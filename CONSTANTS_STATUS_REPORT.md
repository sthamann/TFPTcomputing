# Constant Calculations Status Report

**Date:** 2025-07-25  
**Total Constants:** 70

## Executive Summary

All 70 constant notebooks now exist with proper structure. The project has:
- ‚úÖ 52 original notebooks (now verified to have correct paths)
- ‚úÖ 18 newly created notebooks (with placeholder implementations)
- üìä 25 notebooks with real calculations implemented
- ‚è≥ 18 notebooks needing calculation implementation
- ‚ùì 27 notebooks with unclear status (need review)

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Path Analysis & Fixes ‚úÖ
- Analyzed all 52 existing notebooks for path issues
- Discovered notebooks already had correct relative paths (`../data/`)
- No changes were needed to existing notebooks

### 2. Missing Notebook Creation ‚úÖ
Created 18 missing notebooks with proper template structure:

| Category | Notebooks Created |
|----------|-------------------|
| Anomaly | `delta_a_mu` (Muon g-2 anomaly) |
| Cosmology | `omega_b`, `r_tensor`, `t_gamma_0`, `t_nu` |
| CP Violation | `epsilon_k` |
| Electroweak | `rho_parameter` |
| Lepton | `tau_mu`, `tau_tau` |
| Mixing | `v_cb`, `v_td_v_ts`, `v_us_v_ud` |
| Nuclear | `delta_m_n_p`, `mu_p_mu_n` |
| Quark | `m_s_m_d_ratio`, `m_u` |
| Strong | `f_pi_lambda_qcd`, `lambda_qcd` |

## Current Status

### Notebooks with Implemented Calculations (25)
- `alpha`, `alpha_g`, `alpha_s`, `c_3`, `eta_b`
- `g_1`, `g_2`, `g_f`, `m_b`, `m_c`
- `m_e`, `m_mu`, `m_nu`, `m_p`, `m_p_m_e_ratio`
- `m_planck`, `m_tau`, `m_w`, `m_z`, `phi`
- `phi_0`, `sigma_m_nu`, `sin2_theta_w`, `theta_c`, `v_h`

### Notebooks Needing Implementation (18)
All newly created notebooks need their placeholder calculations replaced with real physics calculations based on their formulas.

### Notebooks with Unclear Status (27)
These notebooks exist but need review to determine if they have proper calculations:
- `a_p`, `alpha_d`, `beta_x`, `c_4`, `c_tfp`
- `chi_d`, `delta_gamma`, `delta_nu_t`, `e_knee`, `f_b`
- And 17 others...

## Key Formulas Needing Implementation

1. **Muon g-2 anomaly**: `Œîa_Œº = (N_E8_VECTORS G_APPROX¬≤) / (8œÄ¬≤) (m_Œº¬≤ / M_HEAVY¬≤) √ó DISPLAY_SCALE`
2. **Neutron-Proton Mass Difference**: `Œîm_n-p = m_e_MEV œÜ‚ÇÄ √ó 48`
3. **CP Violation**: `Œµ_K = œÜ‚ÇÄ¬≤ / ‚àö2`
4. **QCD Scale**: `Œõ_QCD = M_Z exp(-2œÄ / (BETA_0 Œ±_S)) √ó 10¬≥`
5. **CKM Elements**: Various dependencies on œÜ‚ÇÄ

## Technical Issues Encountered

1. **Local Environment**: Jupyter/papermill has compatibility issues with the system
2. **Docker Solution**: Created Docker-based testing framework for reliable execution
3. **Path Context**: Notebooks expect to run from `constants/notebooks/` directory

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Calculations**: Replace placeholders in 18 notebooks with real physics calculations
2. **Review Unclear Notebooks**: Examine the 27 notebooks with unclear status
3. **Test All Notebooks**: Use Docker environment to test all 70 calculations
4. **Validate Accuracy**: Ensure all calculations meet their accuracy targets
5. **Fix Failing Calculations**: Debug and fix any notebooks that don't meet accuracy requirements

## Testing Infrastructure

Created several testing approaches:
- `test_all_constants.py` - Comprehensive papermill-based testing
- Docker-based testing framework for reliable execution
- Direct code extraction testing for quick validation

## Files Created/Modified

- `progress-fixes.md` - Detailed task tracking
- 18 new notebook files in `constants/notebooks/`
- Various temporary test scripts (now cleaned up)

## Recommendations

1. Use Docker environment for all notebook testing to avoid system compatibility issues
2. Implement the 18 placeholder calculations based on their documented formulas
3. Create unit tests for each calculation to ensure accuracy
4. Document any new dependencies or mathematical derivations

**Progress Summary**: Infrastructure is ready, all notebooks exist, now need to implement physics calculations for completeness.
